You can use android studio or visual code. Download my repository( without images files and arduino files because that isnt about flutter app) then you open folder. Write "flutter pub get" in terminal then you can run with emulator


when you open my application you can see my last firebase Temperature and Humidity data. Ä°f you see your temperature date you can change  google-services.json. And you need DHT11 Sensor. So now you can use my database. I share with arduino connections codes (in FirebaseConnection_ESP8266 file) Don't Let Any More Forest Burn Save the world, Save the Future
